Click Prediction Model: Targeting Website Visitors
This project explores building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a website visitor clicking on a specific element (e.g., button, ad).

Key Components:

Data Acquisition: Utilize website clickstream data containing user interactions and website features.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling, potentially including feature engineering.
Model Selection and Training: Experiment with different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to identify the best fit for click prediction.
Evaluation: Analyze model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Explore the relationship between features and clicks to understand the model's decision-making process.
